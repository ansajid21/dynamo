# Dynamo Special Interest Groups

Special Interest Groups (SIGs) are open, standing groups that coordinate work within one domain of the project: roadmap discussion, design review, and cross-area coordination. Anyone may join and participate. The SIG model - what SIGs are, the SIG Lead role, and how SIGs are created, merged, or retired - is defined in [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md); this file is the living roster.

| SIG | Scope | CODEOWNERS Groups |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| sig-core | Core runtime and frontend | `dynamo-runtime-codeowners`, `dynamo-frontend-codeowners`, `dynamo-observability-codeowners` |
| sig-router | Router and the Inference Gateway Endpoint Picker (EPP) | `dynamo-router-codeowners`, `dynamo-epp-codeowners` |
| sig-memory-transport | KV/memory transport and storage | `dynamo-kv-memory-codeowners` |
| sig-agents | Agentic workloads | `dynamo-agents-codeowners` |
| sig-hardware | Hardware platform enablement and optimization, across NVIDIA and non-NVIDIA accelerators | `dynamo-xpu-codeowners` |
| sig-deploy | Deploy path | `dynamo-operator-codeowners` |
| sig-scaling | Scaling and lifecycle | `dynamo-planner-codeowners`, `dynamo-fault-tolerance-codeowners`, `dynamo-gms-codeowners` |
| sig-rl | Reinforcement learning integrations | `dynamo-rl-codeowners` |
| sig-engines | Backend engine integrations (vLLM, SGLang, TensorRT-LLM) | `dynamo-backend-vllm-codeowners`, `dynamo-backend-sglang-codeowners`, `dynamo-backend-trtllm-codeowners`, `dynamo-tokenspeed-codeowners` |
| sig-performance | Performance and AIPerf | `dynamo-performance-codeowners` |
| sig-simulation | Simulation and AIConfigurator | `dynamo-performance-codeowners` |
| sig-multimodal | Multimodal workloads | `dynamo-multimodal-codeowners` |
| sig-diffusion | Diffusion workloads | `dynamo-diffusion-codeowners` |

The `docs`, `ops`, and `process` areas are program functions that Maintainers coordinate themselves; they have no SIG.

## Ecosystem Projects

Several projects in the [ai-dynamo](https://github.com/ai-dynamo) organization live in their own repositories. Each is coordinated by the SIG whose domain it serves: the SIG is where its roadmap and its integration with Dynamo are discussed. Code review and merge authority stay with each repository's own owners.

| Project | Repository | SIG |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| AIPerf | [ai-dynamo/aiperf](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/aiperf) | sig-performance |
| AIConfigurator | [ai-dynamo/aiconfigurator](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/aiconfigurator) | sig-simulation |
| NIXL | [ai-dynamo/nixl](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/nixl) | sig-memory-transport |
| FlexTensor | [ai-dynamo/flextensor](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/flextensor) | sig-memory-transport |
| ModelExpress | [ai-dynamo/modelexpress](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/modelexpress) | sig-rl, sig-scaling |
| Grove | [ai-dynamo/grove](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/grove) | sig-deploy, sig-scaling |
| Snapshot | [ai-dynamo/snapshot](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/snapshot) | sig-scaling, sig-deploy |
| OpenEngine | [ai-dynamo/openengine](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/openengine) | sig-engines, sig-core |
| AITune | [ai-dynamo/aitune](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/aitune) | sig-multimodal, sig-diffusion |
